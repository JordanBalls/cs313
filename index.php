   Welcome! My name is Jordan Balls and I study Computer Science at BYU-Idaho.<br/>
   I've recently become very interested in computer security.<br/>
   I elected to take this class because I believed it would teach me skills
   that would make me more valuable and look good on a resume.<br/>
   In my free time, I enjoy the following:<br/>
   <ul>
   <li> Working Out (trying to bulk up!)</li>
   <li> Reading Books (On book 9 of the Wheel of Time series)</li>
   <li> Playing Video Games, of course! (League of Legends is my main one right now)</li>
   <li> Watching House, recently got addicted and its a great show!</li>
   </ul>
